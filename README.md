## ‚ôø AccessU App

</br>

&nbsp;Checkout our LIVE app here:

&nbsp;https://accessu-undefinedsoc.vercel.app/

</br>

&nbsp; Hello and thanks for your interest in our web app.

&nbsp; We hope you find this document helpful in understanding the problem we aimed to solve, the solution&nbsp; &nbsp; or app we created to solve this problem, how to install the app, details about what's going on in the &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; code and how to use it.

&nbsp; My contribution with this project is with the design, the idea for the app, spinning up the backend(CRUD routes, etc)/deployment of back and front end, testing using Jest and Cypress, and figuring out some of the logic to make it all work together with some of the others. 

To see the fullest showcase of this app, the user data that's currently populated the most is around London/ Soho. So search with these locations for the best experience of what our app can do. 

</br></br>

## ‚ùå The Problem

</br>

- 1 in 4 households are impacted by disability

- 98% of disabled people look for accessibility information before visiting somewhere for the first time.

- Over 75% of disabled people don‚Äôt visit somewhere they wanted to go because they couldn‚Äôt find the accessibility information they needed.

- This results in disabled people making 26% fewer trips than those without a disability.

## üéì Lessons Learned

</br>

Teamwork makes the dream work..

</br>

</br>

A good plan always makes the day run smoother, not perfect, but much better overall.

</br>

</br>

The plan is a living document and can always be iterated upon as you go, it doesn't need to be perfect.

</br>

Break down every problem and then do it again and again..

</br>

Standups and Retros really helped us keep a great rhythm and revise our plan incrementally..

</br>

Keep open communication and share the problems you have when needed, we‚Äôre better together..

</br>

Take your breaks after the mini sprints, stay hydrated and encourage everyone to take a break from the screen..

</br>

Let things go if need be.. Sometimes it‚Äôs just not worth it..
